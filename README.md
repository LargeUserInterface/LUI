# MIT Media Lab Large User Interface (LUI)

With the rise of augmented and virtual reality, new interactive technologies are incorporating immersive user interfaces that leverage gesture and voice recognition in addition to existing controller inputs. However, the state-of-the-art interfaces are quite rudimentary and not widely accessible for the user. Such interfaces require significant amount of sensors, extensive calibration, and/or high latency in the gestural commands. LUI (Large User Interface) is a scalable, multimodal web-interface that uses a custom framework of nondiscrete, free-handed gestures and voice to control modular applications with a single stereo-camera and voice assistant. The gestures and voice input are mapped to ReactJS web elements to provide a highly-responsive and accessible user experience. The menu screen consists of an extendable list of applications, currently including photos, YouTube, etc, which are navigated through our input framework. This interface can be deployed on an AR or VR system, heads-up displays for autonomous vehicles, and everyday large displays.
